How-does-MongoDB-provide-high-performance?

1. It uses BSON instead of JSON for storing data. BSON is binary JSON. Being Binary it improves processing efficiency of the MongoDB.
2. It uses B tree indexing so that they are sorted.
3. Sharding approch improves the query performance in large dataset.

Availability?--
MongoDB provides high availability using master-slave replica set architecture .
Adding more number of slave improves the read query performance as well but it does not improves the write query performance as wtrtting aswalys happens 
at master node.
